# 📈 DayTradeSetup

This project provides a comprehensive and automated framework for planning and executing day trades using Python. It integrates real-time economic events from TradingView, sentiment analysis, and MetaTrader5 for strategy simulation or live trading.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **MetaTrader5 Integration**  
  Connects to the MetaTrader5 terminal to retrieve historical and live data, place trades, and manage positions.

- **TradingView Economic Calendar Scraper**  
  Fetches upcoming economic events using web scraping, allowing users to avoid high-impact events or trade around them.

- **Sentiment Analysis**  
  Analyzes news headlines and other sentiment indicators to aid in trading decision-making (optional integration with NLP models).

- **Automated Trade Planning**  
  Automatically generates trade setups based on user-defined criteria, including time, news impact, market trend, and sentiment.

- **Modular Codebase**  
  Easy to extend with new strategies, indicators, or data sources. Organized for clarity and future scalability.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **MetaTrader5 Python API**
- **Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**
- **BeautifulSoup4 (for scraping TradingView events)**
- **NLTK / TextBlob (optional sentiment tools)**
- **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**
